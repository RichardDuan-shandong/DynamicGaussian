# DynamicGaussian

# 1.gaussian reconstruction √
problem:
1. only use rough seg
2. changeable weight 
3. voxel debug
4. unet needed to be optimzed
# 2.dynamic model ---waiting
# *3.rl algorithom (final goal)
1. data collection √
2. (bc)peract -q transformer ---- how to be optimized with a dynamic model?  ---in rlbench
3. (online?) --- in RoboMimic
